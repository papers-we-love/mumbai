# Papers We ‚ù§ Mumbai

This is the repository for the Mumbai(India) chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/mumbai/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).


### What is Papers We Love?

Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers.

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

You can find previous PWL presentations on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove).

### Who are we?

We are a group of humans who share a common interest for Computer Science.
Papers We Love provides us a platform where we can gather and discuss the various aspects of Computer Science that we find interesting.

Also, turns out Mumbai did not have a local chapter of Papers We Love. So are trying to fix that. Join Us!!
